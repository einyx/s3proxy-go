# S3 Proxy Comprehensive Analysis Report

## Executive Summary

The comprehensive testing suite revealed multiple compatibility and functionality issues with the S3 proxy, particularly around virtual bucket isolation, MinIO client (mc) compatibility, and S3A (Hadoop/Spark) integration.

## Test Results Overview

- **Total Tests Executed:** 48
- **Total Failures:** 12
- **Overall Success Rate:** 75%

### Client-Specific Success Rates

| Client | Success Rate | Key Issues |
|--------|-------------|------------|
| AWS CLI | 84.0% | Generally works well, some HEAD operation failures |
| MinIO Client (mc) | 20.0% | **CRITICAL**: Major compatibility issues |
| Boto3 (S3A-style) | 77.8% | Good compatibility for Spark/Hadoop use cases |

## Critical Issues Identified

### 1. MinIO Client (mc) Complete Failure
**Issue:** MC client cannot upload any files to the proxy
- All upload operations fail with "Object does not exist" error
- Affects all file sizes (1KB to 15MB)
- Multipart uploads also fail

**Root Cause:** Authorization header handling issues identified earlier
- Authorization headers contain newlines/carriage returns
- Proxy tries to clean them but fundamental routing issues remain

**Impact:** CRITICAL - MC client completely unusable

### 2. Virtual Bucket Isolation Issues
**Issue:** Warehouse virtual bucket shows content from wrong prefixes
- Warehouse bucket configured to map to "dev-terraform-managed-bucket" with "warehouse/" prefix
- BUT: listing warehouse/ shows foundation/ content instead
- No samples/ content visible (which is correct)

**Evidence from S3A Testing:**
```
warehouse bucket listing shows:
✓ foundation/ directory (WRONG - should be filtered out)
✓ foundation/foundation.db/* files (WRONG - not in warehouse/ prefix)
✗ No warehouse/* content visible
```

### 3. HEAD Operation Failures
**Issue:** HEAD requests consistently fail with 404 errors
- Affects both uploaded objects and existing objects
- All clients (AWS CLI, MC, Boto3) affected
- Critical for S3A/Spark operations that depend on HEAD for existence checks

### 4. Prefix Filtering Logic Error
**Issue:** The prefix filtering in `ListObjectsWithDelimiter` is not working correctly

**Code Analysis:**
In `/internal/storage/s3.go:621-628`, the filtering logic:
```go
if bucketPrefix != "" && !strings.HasPrefix(key, bucketPrefix) {
    // Filter out objects not in bucket prefix
    continue
}
```

**Problem:** This filters objects that DON'T start with the prefix, but warehouse bucket shows foundation/ content, suggesting the opposite logic is needed or prefix mapping is incorrect.

## Configuration Analysis

Current configuration maps:
- Virtual bucket: `warehouse`
- Real bucket: `dev-terraform-managed-bucket`
- Prefix: `warehouse/`

**Expected Behavior:** 
- `ls warehouse/` should show only objects with keys starting with `warehouse/` in the real bucket
- Objects like `warehouse/mlflow/*` should be visible
- Objects like `foundation/*` should NOT be visible

**Actual Behavior:**
- `ls warehouse/` shows `foundation/*` objects
- No `warehouse/*` objects visible

## S3A (Spark/Hadoop) Compatibility

**Good News:** 
- Basic listing operations work
- Can discover Iceberg metadata files
- Path-style addressing works correctly

**Issues:**
- HEAD operations fail (critical for Spark)
- No metadata files found in expected locations
- May impact Iceberg table discovery

## Recommendations

### Immediate (Critical) Fixes

1. **Fix Virtual Bucket Prefix Logic**
   - Review `getPrefixForBucket()` and `ListObjectsWithDelimiter()` logic
   - Ensure warehouse bucket only shows `warehouse/*` prefixed objects
   - Test prefix filtering thoroughly

2. **Fix MinIO Client Compatibility**
   - Investigate mc client routing issues beyond authorization headers
   - May need mc-specific handling in router or handler

3. **Fix HEAD Operations**
   - Investigate why HEAD requests fail for existing objects
   - Critical for S3A/Spark compatibility

### Medium Priority

4. **Multipart Upload Robustness**
   - Review multipart upload implementation
   - Ensure proper error handling and cleanup

5. **Add Comprehensive Logging**
   - Add detailed request/response logging for debugging
   - Include bucket mapping resolution logging

### Testing and Validation

6. **Create Bucket Content**
   - Populate real bucket with test content in correct prefixes
   - Test with actual `warehouse/*` prefixed objects

7. **Integration Testing**
   - Test with real Iceberg/Spark workloads
   - Validate end-to-end data access patterns

## Technical Deep Dive

### Virtual Bucket Mapping Flow

Expected:
1. Client requests `warehouse/file.txt`
2. Proxy maps to `dev-terraform-managed-bucket`
3. Adds prefix: `warehouse/file.txt` → `warehouse/file.txt`
4. S3 request: `GET dev-terraform-managed-bucket/warehouse/file.txt`

Issue: Step 3 may be adding prefix incorrectly or filtering wrong content.

### MinIO Client Analysis

MC client failures suggest fundamental request routing issues:
- Authorization header cleaning fixes some issues but not all
- May need mc-specific request handling
- Error "Object does not exist" suggests routing/mapping failure

## Next Steps

1. **Priority 1:** Fix virtual bucket prefix filtering logic
2. **Priority 2:** Debug and fix HEAD operation failures  
3. **Priority 3:** Resolve mc client compatibility
4. **Priority 4:** Comprehensive integration testing

The proxy shows promise for AWS CLI and Boto3/S3A usage but needs critical fixes for production readiness, especially for MinIO client compatibility and correct virtual bucket isolation.
